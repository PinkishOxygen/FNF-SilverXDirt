# FNF-SilverXDirt
A custom mod for Friday Night Funkin

this was a mod i made a while back but i lost access to my account in which the mod was held in so i remade it here

# How to Run

it pretty basic, if you're running it in a seperate IDE (idk why but ok) just do:

```git clone https://github.com/PinkishOxygen/FNF-SilverXDirt```

then run the code

another alternative is using my link in which I have made.

edit: i test the 'git clone' thing on replit, it creates a folder with all the files so in order for it to work you're going to need to drag the files out of the 'FNF-SilverXDirt' folder
